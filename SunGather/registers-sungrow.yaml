# v2.0.0

# Updated register support to Sungrow specifications ´Communication
# Protocol of PV Grid-Connected String Inverters V1.1.46` and ´Communication
# Protocol of Residential Hybrid Inverter V1.1.2`.

# Support of all inverter models - hybrid or non-hybrid - that are either
# mentioned in the specifications or have been part of this file before. In
# general nothing that was specified as supported should ever be removed from
# this file to avoid breaking stuff unless it is proven to be wrong.

# Some registers are available in specific countries only. SunGather is not
# aware of the location of the inverter's operation or country specific
# inverter models in general. Such limitations are therefore not specified in
# this file. This means that depending on the country of operation or country
# of origin of an inverter registers may not be available even if they should
# be according to this file.

# Non-hybrid models

# The specification mentions some models for which no device type codes are
# provided. The automatic discovery of such models will fail (unless they share
# a device type code with another supported model and will thus be regognized
# accordingly). Such a model can still be configured in the config.yaml file to
# override the automatic discovery. Such models are treated just like normal in
# the register support.

# In some cases registers are supported by all models (hybrid and non-hybrid)
# with exception of a single model. In such cases the register is specified to
# support all models.

# Added registers for non-hybrid inverters:

# - local_remote_control (5021)
# - work_status_1 (5140)
# - work_status_2 (5141
# - quick_grid_dispatch_mode (32569)
# - swift_grid_dispatch_mode (32570)

# Omitted registers for non-hybrid inverters (these are actually a set of
# registers each):

# - Q(P) curve 1 (reg. no. 31)
# - Q(U) curve 1 (reg. no. 32)
# - Q(P) curve 2 (reg. no. 33)
# - Q(U) curve 2 (reg. no. 33)


# Hybrid models

# Some discontinued models are not listed in the specification anymore, but are
# contained in previous versions of this file. This applies to models SH5K-20,
# SH3K6, SH4K6, SH5K-V13, SH5K-30, SH3K6-30, SH4K6-30. The register support of
# these models is frozen in this version of the file, i.e. supported registers
# are not removed, however new registers are not specified as supported by
# these models due to lack of information.

# The file contains a model SH4.6RS which is not mentioned anywhere in the
# specification for unknown reasons. Because according to the naming schema
# this mode is part of the SH*RS series of inverters it is assumed that it
# supports the same registers as the other models of this series.

# Note that register support for hybrid inverters is limited if they are not
# connected via a dedicated LAN port. The registers in the address range 6100
# .. 6826 are limited according to the specification: "WINET-S forwarding via
# Ethernet TCP/IP is not supported". This limitation is not built into this
# file. SunGather is not aware of how it is connected to an inverter and could
# not make use of this information.

# Added registers for hybrid inverters:

# Completed the yearly values of generation and export. Years before 2019 are
# level 3, later years level 2.

# - yearly_pv_generation_2015 (6250)
# - yearly_pv_generation_2016 (6252)
# - yearly_pv_generation_2017 (6254)
# - yearly_pv_generation_2018 (6256)
# - yearly_pv_generation_2030 (6280)
# - yearly_pv_generation_2031 (6282)
# - yearly_pv_generation_2032 (6284)
# - yearly_pv_generation_2033 (6286)
# - yearly_pv_generation_2034 (6288)
# - yearly_export_2015 (6608)
# - yearly_export_2016 (6610)
# - yearly_export_2017 (6612)
# - yearly_export_2018 (6614)
# - yearly_export_2029 (6636)
# - yearly_export_2030 (6638)
# - yearly_export_2031 (6640)
# - yearly_export_2032 (6642)
# - yearly_export_2033 (6644)
# - yearly_export_2034 (6646)

# Bugfix: Type

# - forced_charging (33208)

# v1.0.1

# Bugfix: register total_power_yields / 5004: set accuracy to 0.1
 
# v1.0.0 - 2024-02-28: version "1.0.0 evo (0.2.3)"

# First version in the SunGatherEvo fork, own versioning. The version number
# this file was forked off is "0.2.3". This version mainly contains changes to
# adapt to Sungrow Specification ´Communication Protocol of Residential Hybrid
# Inverter` V1.1.2

# Added model SH8.0RT-V112 to any register which supports model SH8.0RT (verified)

# Changed registers:

# - register device_type_code: Added all supported devices according to
# specification, appendix 4.6

# - added more states to register 13000 / system_state. Also changed code
# 0x0002 to 0x0000 for state "Running" (according to Specification). Code
# 0x0002 was also already used for "shutdown (which is correct according to
# Specification). Probably this was a typo ...

# - Added all supported models according to specification to the register 13001
# / running_state.

# Corrected registers from S32 to S16:

# - backup_a_phase_power (5723)
# - backup_b_phase_power (5724)
# - backup_c_phase_power (5725)

# Added registers (addresses in parentheses):
 
# - battery_power_wide_range (5214)
# - backup_a_phase_current (5720), backup_b_phase_current (5721), backup_c_phase_current (5722)
# - backup_a_phase_voltage (5731), backup_b_phase_voltage (5732), backup_c_phase_voltage (5733)
# - battery_capacity_high_precision (5639)
# - grid_frequency_high_precision (5242),
# - battery_current_signed (5631),
# - backup_frequency (5734)
# - max_charging_power (33047)

# - ems_mode_selection (13050)
# - charge_discharge_command (13051)

# Added state registers derived from the register system_state (address 13001).
# These have values of either 1 or 0, indicating 1 as true, 0 as false. The
# registers have the same model entry as their ancestor, running_state / 13001:

# - power_flow_state_battery_charging
# - power_flow_state_battery_discharging
# - power_flow_state_feed_into_grid
# - power_flow_state_import_from_grid
# - power_flow_state_load_active
# - power_flow_state_power_generated_from_load
# - power_flow_state_power_generated_from_pv

# All new registers have the following models supported. These are those that
# are listed in the specification plus the SH4.6RS model which is not listed
# but was existing in this file before:

# models: ["SH3.0RS","SH3.6RS","SH4.0RS","SH5.0RS","SH4.6RS","SH6.0RS","SH8.0RS","SH10RS","SH5.0RT","SH6.0RT","SH8.0RT","SH10RT","SH5.0RT-20","SH6.0RT-20","SH8.0RT-20","SH10RT-20","SH5.0RT-V112","SH6.0RT-V112","SH8.0RT-V112","SH10RT-V112","SH5.0RT-V122","SH6.0RT-V122","SH8.0RT-V122","SH10RT-V122","SH5T-V11","SH6T-V11","SH8T-V11","SH10T-V11","SH12T-V11","SH15T-V11","SH20T-V11","SH25T-V11"]
 
# Limitations

# No updates or changes regarding other series of inverters. Model dependencies
# as inherited from the original file or adapted to specification, NOT TESTED
# (except verification with an SH8.0RT-V112).
